# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why NAnPack is build on Python and not C++ or Fortran?

**The primary objective of this project is to have a numerical computations package that can be easily used by everyone, be it a student, or a researcher in industry or academia or even someone working individually and that requires less time spent on development and more time dedicated to research.**

Keeping this in mind it was decided to build NAnPack on Python language.
Here are some key factors that went into thinking:

* Firstly, its open-source.
* Python is easy to learn becuase of its simple syntax.
* Installation of Python and its components is super-easy.
* The pre-exisiting libraries and modules in Python save developers from "reinventing the wheel".
* All processing stages of scientific computations can be executed in a few lines of codes without requiring external third-party softwares/programs.   
For example, data visualization can be done using Python libraries without having to learn and pay to use commercial visualization softwares. 
* Jupyter Notebook built for Python is a versatile browser based tool which makes the development, documentation, and code testing comparatively easy and requires less time.
* There are tons of tutorials, blog posts and support available for Python developers.

### Why use NAnPack and not other available commercial or open-source softwares?

* NAnPack is an open-source package, written in simple functional programming paradigm instead of object-oriented programming paradigm that can be easily understood by anyone with minimum programming experience who are interested in learning Computational Engineering and also by teachers.
* Most academicians prefer Fortran and we have written NAnPack codes to make transition from Fortran to Python easy for them.
* Our codes can be used as a foundation to develop and run complex simulations.
* In our knowledge, there are no open-source software available that supports learning for beginners in a way that we aim to do.
* Commercial softwares for Students provides learning only on how to press some buttons and run the application instead of providing the information on what is going on behind the scenes.
