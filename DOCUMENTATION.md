NAnPack project is a collection of numerical solvers developed on Python programming for research and teaching in fluid dynamics. It is developed as an open-source package that can be used in academia for teaching and research.
    
NAnPack is capable of computationally solving the 1D and 2D Heat Transfer Equation, Navier-Stokes equation, Burgers equation on structured non-uniform grids using several finite difference and finite volume methods. It includes the complete life-cycle stages for the numerical experimentation of a physical problem which is pre-processing, running iterable/time-dependent simulations, and post-processing. 
    
This package is developed using functional programming paradigm to promote ease-of-use and accomadate all users within the scientific community having different coding skills.
    
This code has been developed by a researcher for researchers.
