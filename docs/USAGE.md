The NAnPack Learners edition is intended to be used for the purpose of teaching and learning various numerical schemes for solving partial differential equations in engineering and science.

## Objective
The sole objective of NAnPack-Learners package is to impart learning in numerical schemes and coding in a simplified approach to those who want to develop a necessary background for Computational Engineering and Sciences, especially, in Computational Fluid Dynamics. It is expected of users that they will use the libraries in this package and write their own codes or scripts to run simulations and analyse the output. The only pre-requisite is to have an interest and some experience in coding, physics and calculus.

An important motivation behind the development of this package is to equip CFD enthusiasts with the complete know-how. Therefore, our aim is to provide complete information regarding what is going on behind the scenes when you run a simulation starting from the very basic. With commercially available softwares you will learn how to press some buttons and create beautiful simulations without learning or having any idea about how it is being done.

## Getting Started
To get started with this package download, installation, and running initial tests, please see here.


## Using NAnPack-Learners
Use NAnPack-Learners package to develop a fundamental background in computational methods in engineering. The package is designed in such a manner that the users are provided with the necessary tools and they are expected to build and execute their scripts using the package libraries to run simulations and generate graphical outputs. 

Background on numerical schemes, physics, and built-in functions are provided in the tutorials in the blog section. The procedure to write your scripts with examples are also provided in the blogs which is continuously updated with new examples.

Users may follow the instructions and examples to learn to develop their codes. 
Users may also submit your examples through GitHub pull requests and contribute to the documentation. We recommend users to follow and subscribe the blogs to stay updated.
