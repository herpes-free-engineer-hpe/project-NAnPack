## NAnPack

An open-source package of numerical solvers based on finite-difference and finite volume methods for one-dimensional and two-dimensional partial differential equations written in Python language and inteded for use in teaching and learning. The package is currently being developed for Computational Fluid Dynamics applications and the modules for electromagnetics, hypersonic chemically reacting flows, and other physical applications will be included in the future versions.
